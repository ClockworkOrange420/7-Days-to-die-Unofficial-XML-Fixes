This one is questionable (so I have not made this fix) as to which you would like to use the axe for sicne it cant be purposed to be used for both!

Fireaxe: changed from "Blade Weapons" to "Mining Tools" so blockDamage is increased with skills instead of entityDamage. ?

I personally feel that the axe is meant to be a tool and not a weapon but i will leave this one up to you to decide if you wish to make this change. If you do decide to make this change please let me know and I will update it on my github!
